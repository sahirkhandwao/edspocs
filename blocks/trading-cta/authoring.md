## Setup Instructions

1.  **Add the Block**: In your Markdown file (e.g., `home.md`), create a table with the name `Trading CTA`.
2.  **Define Content**:
    *   **Column 1**: Enter the catchy headline (e.g., "Enjoy brokerage as low as 0.01%* Enroll now").
    *   **Column 2**: Enter the button text (e.g., "OPEN TRADING A/C"). If left blank, it defaults to "OPEN TRADING A/C".
3.  **Preview**: The block will automatically render a light blue box with a mobile number input and a red action button.
